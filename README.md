# Rock-Paper-Scissors game
 This is the simple Rock-Paper-Scissor game, created using python. I have used the *randint()* inbuilt function of the **Random** module. There are two players in this game, one is human and other is computer. 
 Game rule : 
 * Rock wins over Scissor
 * Paper wins over Rock
 * Scissor wins over Paper
